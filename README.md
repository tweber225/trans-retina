Version 2: July 2017 (1-4 colors+more features)


MATLAB code to run camera in sync with alternating LEDs (up to 4) for trans-scleral retina imaging. 
In the directory: "cam_exposure_LED_sync" is a Arduino sketch file that should syncronize exposure signals and the LED outputs

In the future repo may include some analysis code.



Features to add to GUI:

-Partially completed: hot keys to start preview, capture modes or exposure times or LED choices

-Useful: real-time image level flattening

-Low priority: limit on number of frames for capture mode (to avoid over allocating memory)

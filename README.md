# trans-retina

MATLAB code to run camera in sync with alternating LEDs (up to 4) for trans-scleral retina imaging. 
In the directory: "cam_exposure_LED_sync" is a Arduino sketch file that should syncronize exposure signals and the LED outputs

In the future repo may include some analysis code.



Features to add to GUI:

-Would be very useful: separate enable buttons for capture mode set of LEDs (i.e. different LEDs for Preview and Capture Modes)

-Low priority: limit on number of frames for capture mode (to avoid over allocating memory)
